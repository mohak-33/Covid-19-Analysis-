# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project is a data analysis of COVID-19 using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to understand the impact and spread of the coronavirus across different regions by examining trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

## Project Description

The notebook performs:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis
- Time-based analysis to track how COVID-19 spread over days and months
- Country-wise comparisons to understand how different nations were affected
- Visualizations using graphs and charts to highlight trends and patterns in the data

The analysis provides a statistical and visual understanding of the pandemic, helping identify peak periods, regional differences, and the effectiveness of responses over time.

## Conclusions

- The spread of COVID-19 showed clear upward trends in cases and deaths during certain months, especially in densely populated countries.
- Countries with timely intervention measures saw a slower rate of increase in cases compared to others.
- Fatality and recovery rates varied significantly across regions, possibly due to differences in healthcare infrastructure and policy responses.
- Visualizations helped uncover patterns in how the virus spread, including second and third waves in some countries.
- Overall, the data emphasizes the importance of quick and coordinated global health responses during pandemics.
